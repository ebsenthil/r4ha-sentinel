📊 R4HA ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================
1. **Current Situation**: The current R4HA is 410.0 MSU, with a current MSU utilization of 420.0. The system is operating well below the threshold of 1000 MSU, indicating a low workload typical for a Sunday afternoon.

2. **Historical Trend**: Over the past two hours, the R4HA has been increasing, moving from 395.0 MSU two hours ago to 400.0 MSU one hour ago, and now at 410.0 MSU.

3. **Prediction**: The model predicts that the R4HA will slightly increase to approximately 412.83 MSU in the next hour.

4. **Trend Analysis**: Historically, the R4HA has been increasing, and the prediction suggests a continuation of this trend, albeit at a slower rate. The predicted trend is labeled as "STABLE," indicating minimal change.

5. **Risk Assessment**: LOW. Both the current and predicted R4HA values are significantly below the threshold of 1000 MSU, with no alerts triggered.

6. **Immediate Actions**: No immediate actions are necessary. Continue monitoring the system to ensure it remains within acceptable performance parameters.

7. **Explanation**: The prediction aligns with the observed historical trend of increasing R4HA values, though the rate of increase is expected to slow down. This makes sense given the low workload environment typical for a Sunday afternoon, with minimal batch processing activity and moderate CPU utilization. The system is stable and operating efficiently within its capacity limits.
